        I've created an app that fetches user profiles and their posts, with an
        additional section for comments. While it may not be my magnum opus, I
        diligently followed instructions to craft this tool. It was developed
        with the goal of assisting with a job application, showcasing my ability
        to follow directions and deliver functional solutions. Though it won't
        make it to my profile, it serves its purpose.
